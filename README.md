# TestGPT

Following a lecture given by Andrej Karpathy: [Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY). The goal of this is to better understand GPT under the hood and apply what I will learn to a personal project.

The original code base from the lecture is available at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/karpathy/ng-video-lecture/tree/master).
